The only file worth anything is fours.hs

The solve function takes a list of numbers and a single number and returns all the ways that list can be combined with basic arithmetic into that single number.

Input: [1,2,3,4] 10

output:
     
     (1 + 2) + (3 + 4) = 10
     
     (1 * 2 * 3) + 4 = 10
     and so on....
     
 Output will always include parenthesis because any expression without parenthesis can be expressed with them as well.


This is actually a pretty dang hard programming challenge, and my favorite. Give it a try if you want to challenge yourself.
